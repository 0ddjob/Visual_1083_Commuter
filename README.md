## Power Supply
The internal power supply is switchable, by moving a wire, between 115VAC and 230VAC.  Note that it contains three RIFA filtering capacitors that should be replaced, especially if original.

## Cooling Fan
There is a cooling fan situated next to the power supply.  As this is an AC fan ... with no markings (in my case, at least) ... you will likely need to replace it if you are switching voltages - assume it's a 115VAC-rated fan.<br>
It's dimensions are 80mm square and 42mm deep.
